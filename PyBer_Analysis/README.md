# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
We are tasked with carrying out an exploratory analysis for Pyber, a Python based ride-sharing app company. Using several types of visualizations using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib, we showcase the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis we provide will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results

We can see that compared to Rural and Suburban neighborhoods, Urban neighborhoods generate the most revenue. Urban neighborhoods have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per river at $24.53 and $16.57 respectively, total drivers at 2,405 drivers, total rides at 1,625 and and total fares at $39,854.38.

Suburban neighborhoods have average fares per ride at $30.97, average fare per driver at $39.50, total drivers at 490, total rides at 625, and total fares of $19,356.33.

Rural neighborhoods have average fares per ride at $34.62, average fare per driver at $55.49, total drivers at 78, total rides at 125, and total fares of $4,327.93. 

The average fare per ride and average fare per driver increases in relation to where there are less total drivers and less total rides.
It can be deduced that the low amount of total fares can be attributed to Suburban and Rural populations owning cars, thus less reliance on ridesharing. 
The increased fare of Rural and Suburban neighborhoods are in direct relation to the lower number of total rides and drivers. Despite this, there is more potential to grow within the Suburban market. Total fares in the Suburban market is at $19,356.33, that is $20,498.05 less that Urban but is $15,028.40 more than Rural.
There is potential in both Suburban and Rural markets, but Rural will be a more difficult market to grow.
