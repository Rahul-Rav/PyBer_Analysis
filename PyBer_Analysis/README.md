# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
We are tasked with carrying out an exploratory analysis for Pyber, a Python based ride-sharing app company. Using several types of visualizations using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib, we showcase the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis we provide will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results

We can see that compared to Rural and Suburban neighborhoods, Urban neighborhoods generate the most revenue. Urban neighborhoods have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per river at $24.53 and $16.57 respectively, total drivers at 2,405 drivers, total rides at 1,625 and and total fares at $39,854.38.

Suburban neighborhoods have average fares per ride at $30.97, average fare per driver at $39.50, total drivers at 490, total rides at 625, and total fares of $19,356.33.

Rural neighborhoods have average fares per ride at $34.62, average fare per driver at $55.49, total drivers at 78, total rides at 125, and total fares of $4,327.93. 

The average fare per ride and average fare per driver increases in relation to where there are less total drivers and less total rides.
It can be deduced that the low amount of total fares can be attributed to Suburban and Rural populations owning cars, thus less reliance on ridesharing. 
The increased fare of Rural and Suburban neighborhoods are in direct relation to the lower number of total rides and drivers. Despite this, there is more potential to grow within the Suburban market. Total fares in the Suburban market is at $19,356.33, that is $20,498.05 less that Urban but is $15,028.40 more than Rural.
There is potential in both Suburban and Rural markets, but Rural will be a more difficult market to grow.

The figure above displays data grouped by weeks providing trends of total fares by city type.
The chart displays when peaks occur that are shared between all three city types, these peaks occurring in late February and early March.
Compared to the previous figure, we can see that Urban neighborhoods generate the highest revenue and Rural generates the lowest.


## Summary
It is clear that Urban cities use ridesharing significantly more than Suburban and especially Rural cities, total rides eclipses the total rides and drivers, as well as the average fare per ride and per driver being significantly higher for Rural cities. This could be seen as a discouraging factor for potential Pyber customers in using the ridesharing app. Perhaps a possible solution would be to temporarily decrease the price of fares or offer a promotion in rural neighborhoods in order to create a customer base and show them the potential value in using this service.

When comparing the average fare per driver in Rural and Urban cities, Urban drivers get paid significantly less than Rural drivers. Though there are significantly more drivers in Urban cities, the low wages that they earn could be seen as discouraging for potential drivers. Since there are a large amount of customers who use Pyber as their main method of transportation, increasing the fare by a certain percentage in order to create a higher average fare per driver could increase more drivers to drive for Pyber thus increasing access to Urban customers even further and increasing total fare revenue.

Suburban cities sit directly in the middle of Urban and Rural cities and has seen a stable trend with an increase at the end of the 'Total Fare by City Type' figure. Action does not necessarily need to be taken on this city type but perhaps the budget can be reallotted from Suburban to help increase ridership in Rural areas and increase wages for drivers in Urban neighborhoods.
