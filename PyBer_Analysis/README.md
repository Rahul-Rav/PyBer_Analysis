# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
We are tasked with carrying out an exploratory analysis for Pyber, a Python based ride-sharing app company. Using several types of visualizations using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib, we showcase the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis we provide will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
